# script-jacking

## what is it?

Script-jacking is a term I just invented, but I'm probably not the first to write about it.
It describes the possibility that a victim's website could run an external script, created by the attacker, which would act harmlessly, like a trojan horse, at first.

Later, it could effect the website, "clicking" things on the user-side, or deleting the page and writing "HACKED!!!". This can be quite easily deleted, but its effects could range from annoying, to potentially very disruptive.

An annoying example of this is: https://mrsherlockholmes.github.io/script-jacking

## okay, how do I fix it??

A good idea is to recheck all the external script files you run. It's best to avoid obfuscated scripts. If you want to feel even safer, you could check unusual scripts for element change. That could, at least, serve as a deterrent.

Well, that's what'll happen.
