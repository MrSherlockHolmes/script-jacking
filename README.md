# script-jacking

## what is it?

Script-jacking is a term I just invented, but I'm probably not the first to write about it.
It describes the possibility that a victim's website could run an external script, created by the attacker, which would act harmlessly, like a trojan horse, at first.

Later, it could effect the website, "clicking" things on the user-side, or deleting the page and writing "HACKED!!!". This can be quite easily deleted, but its effects could range from annoying, to potentially very disruptive.

An annoying example of this is: https://mrsherlockholmes.github.io/script-jacking

## okay, how do I fix it??

Well, you could trust a script _(although in theory it could script-jack you)_ which checks a script for disruptive javascript.
